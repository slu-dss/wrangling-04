## Lesson Overview
This repository contains the third lesson for the Data Wrangling in R seminar. This lesson covers the basics of using using `dplyr`'s `group_by` and `summarise` functions to created grouped summaries.

### Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, learners should be able to:

1. Create a basic grouped summary of the count of observations
2. Construct more complex grouped summaries using window functions
3. Integrated grouped summaries with other `dplyr` functions 

### Lesson Resources
* The [`SETUP.md`](/references/SETUP.md) file in the [`references/`](/references) directory contains a list of packages required for this lesson
* The [`notebook/`](/notebook) directory contains our primary teaching materials, included a completed version of the notebook we will be working on during the seminar.
* The [lesson slides](https://slu-dss.github.io/wrangling-01/) provide an overview of the DSS and data cleaning.
* The [`references/`](/references) directory also contains other notes on changes to the repository, key topics, terms, data sources, and software.

### Extra Resources
* [*R for Data Science*, Chapter 5 - Data Transformation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html)
* [RStudio's `dplyr` Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#dplyr)

### Lesson Quick Start
#### Install Necessary Packages
The packages we'll need for today can be installed using:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "gapminder", "here", "knitr", "rmarkdown", "usethis"))
```

#### Download Lesson Materials
You can download this lesson to your Desktop easily using `usethis`:

```r
usethis::use_course("https://github.com/slu-dss/wrangling-04/archive/master.zip")
```

By using `usethis::use_course`, all of the lesson materials will be downloaded to your computer, automatically extracted, and saved to your desktop. You can then open the `.Rproj` file to get started.
